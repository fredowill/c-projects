2. 20 hours
3. I figured out how to use pointers as well as navigating passing by reference/freeing memory.
4. When using gdb, I didn't encounter any bugs, but I was able to see that my code was errorproof by making breakpoints. When I made those breakpoints, I was able to see that all of my loops itereated the correct amount of times and made sure my pointers were getting allocated space. It was harder to see the values of pointers since I might not have acess to seeing the data at a certian point of the program (segmentation error) but I could see/print other things.
